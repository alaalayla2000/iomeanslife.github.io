# Thoughts, Conversations, Miscellaneous

In this category I will write about things that peaked my interest or had conversations over.

### GBAssembler

This is a project of a dear friend of mine. In his video series ho goes through the steps required to build an assembler for the classic Gameboy. I suggest giving it a watch.

### AWS

A colleaue of mine is getting training in AWS Solutions and mentions a few things in passing. Something about people with no experience in AWS being able to set up a working solution in just 30 hours. I wonder if I should look into that some day.

### Romania

Interesting people. The older generation is stuck in conservative religious ways, but the younger one is more worldly and modern, partly hustling in cities like London and working in service or IT. It'd be cool if they'd get a big IT and finance industry going, they certainly do have the skilled labourers for that.
