        <h1>Learning Rust for tools and games</h1>
<p>Have you ever heard of Rust Programming? I've been on and off trying to learn it, but the times are just too stressful so I have to choose my battles. But why learn Rust in the first place? Other than joining the hype, there are certain things about rust that intrigue me.</p>
<p><img class="content" src="./../media/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg" alt="Rust Logo" /></p>
<p>Rust was started by Mozilla Research and has been going strong, winning the &quot;most loved programming language&quot; category on Stack Exchange every year since 2016. It has all the right open source licenses and a solid set of tools and first class IDE extensions. Adaptation in the industry is going at a slower pace than most would like, which I suspect is due to it being &quot;closer to the metal&quot;, making it a difficult option to consider in brownfield projects.</p>
<p>Instead of me rambling on, find out more under the homepage at https://www.rust-lang.org/</p>
<p>I've been programming in C# for over 10 years. It served me well, but there were a few painpoints like erratic perfomance and .Net only being recently open source. Now instead of learning all the pitfalls in C++, with Rust I'd get a go at system programming and still have memory allocation sorted out for me.</p>
<p>I got up to chapter 13 in the Rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html I'll try to pick it up again when https://iomeanslife.github.io is in a state I am satisfied with.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with Rust? Feel free to hit me up on twitter or per mail, which can be found in the aside.</p>
<p>Stay Safe</p>
<p>Omar</p>
