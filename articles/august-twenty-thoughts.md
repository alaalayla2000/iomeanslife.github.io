# Thoughts for August 2020

This month has been stressful and I haven't achieved much. Here are some thoughts.

## Phone falling apart

My Huawei had completely shattered display for a while, and other than watching content and using the touch keyboard being a pain, it also has too little storage, runs terribly and has to much trash preloaded that I can't remove. I had a Nokia for a bit longer than half a year, but that one's USB-C slot was faulty, and it got lost in repair, taking whatever data I couldn't save along with it. had to go back to said Huawei but I really need a new one.

## Wishlist: Fairphone 3

The world is in a terrible situation since from the  Boomer generation on, we all sort of just let go of principles to get things cheaper. Now that we see how that has caused terrible suffering of people and nature as well as the rise of troubling super powers, it is time to overthink how we consume. Buying the most important gadget in today's generation fairly would make a good start, so I am eying the Fairphone 3. It is less capable than other phones in that price range, but that makes sense since it isn't made with human suffering and planet poisining. Now saving up Â£400 is tough.

## Developing a finance app

I started working on a finance app, with some interruptions caused by having to solve coding challenges like the bird-chase-game. I have made a prototype that is capable of reading the CSV export from monzo and displaying the statements in a list. But the break caused me to lose the whole concept that I had in mind and I need to reshape my ideas to a more concrete concept. I was thinking of prototyping all features that I had in mind and then see how they would mesh.
