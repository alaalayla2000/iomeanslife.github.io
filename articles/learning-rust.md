# Learning Rust for tools and games

Have you ever heard of Rust Programming? I've been on and off trying to learn it, but the times are just too stressful so I have to choose my battles. But why learn Rust in the first place? Other than joining the hype, there are certain things about rust that intrigue me.

Rust was started by Mozilla Research and has been going strong, winning the "most loved programming language" category on Stack Exchange every year since 2016. It has all the right open source licenses and a solid set of tools and first class IDE extensions. Adaptation in the industry is going at a slower pace than most would like, which I suspect is due to it being "closer to the metal", making it a difficult option to consider in brownfield projects.

Instead of me rambling on, find out more under the homepage at https://www.rust-lang.org/

I've been programming in C# for over 10 years. It served me well, but there were a few painpoints like erratic perfomance and .Net only being recently open source. Now instead of learning all the pitfalls in C++, with Rust I'd get a go at system programming and still have memory allocation sorted out for me.

I got up to chapter 13 in the Rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html I'll try to pick it up again when https://iomeanslife.github.io is in a state I am satisfied with.

What are your experiences with Rust? Feel free to hit me up on twitter or per mail, which can be found in the aside.

Stay Safe
