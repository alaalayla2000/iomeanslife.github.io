# Learning Rust for tools and games

Have you ever heard of Rust Programming? I've been on and off trying to learn it, but the times are just too stressful so I have to choose my battles. But why learn Rust in the first place? Other than joining the hype, there are certain things about rust that intrigue me.

## About Rust

Rust was started by Mozilla Research and has been going strong, winning the "most loved programming language" category on Stack Exchange every year since 2016. It has all the right open source licenses and a solid set of tools and first class IDE extensions. Adaptation in the industry is going at a slower pace than most would like, which I suspect is due to it being "closer to the metal", making it a difficult option to consider in brownfield projects.

## Why I like Rust

### A new beginning
I've been programming in C# for over 10 years more or less successfully. It started with a good friend of mine teaching it to me and then making small games in XNA. Being terrible in school and finding out that the market likes tools and components written with .Net, I ended up using what I learned to earn my paycheck until recently. Making games though more and more escaped me, despite gaining experience in the Unity3D engine and creating a TTS game prototype and a HoloLens App for an employer. The failure was, that I couldn't get more games done to pad out a portfolio that would interest a game studio, and business software were just easier to get into, with a better pay.
