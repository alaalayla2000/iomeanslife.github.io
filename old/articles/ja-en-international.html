        <h1>Practical standards for daily use in an international environment</h1>
<p>There are only two things Germans like more than anything else, even more than “Fußball”, ”Bier” or “Kraftfahrzeuge deutscher Herkunft”. Which are “Prozesse” and “Standards”.</p>
<p>Growing up as a German citizen, I learned that not only does every problem have a solution, but that said solution has the necessary steps and requirements already defined in a manual somewhere, no exceptions. There are certain benefits to processes and standards i.e. they make it easier to look up things, or keeping instructions concise by simply referring to something the right way. They also shift responsibility upwards, so someone can work with peace of mind instead of having to figure out things on the fly, as long as they stick to the process.</p>
<p>Here are a few standards and conventions that might come in handy in an international context, notably between english and japanese.</p>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>In places like the UK and Germany, dates are usually written in the “DMY” order, but “YMD” is acknowledged there too, which is the default for places like Japan or China. Problems begin, when the writer's intention isn’t clear, i.e. “20.5” usually means &quot;the twentieth of may&quot; in the UK, but as the best before date on a Japanese product it mostl likely means &quot;by the end of may 2020&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Noting the date in the ISO 8601 format helps with situations like these. The full date would be “2020-05-20”, for the best before date “2020-05” and the shortened version with current year “--05-20”.</p>
<h2>Family Name</h2>
<p>The personal name can be ordered by either the western name order which is the norm for the UK, or the eastern name order which is the go to in Japan. If one were to write a formal message they would need to know beforehand about the order, by either knowing what goes for the recipient their name’s origin, or having the name noted somewhere in a way which makes it clear.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> While not a standard (yet), There is this practice of writing the family name in capital letters, so the family name can be recognized no matter if it’s written “AJERRAY Omar” or “Omar AJERRAY”.</p>
<h2>Check Mark</h2>
<p>Let’s think of a test sheet. If it is all checkmarks (✔), it means someone aced the test in the UK, but in Japan they would be sent to supplementary lessons for bombing the test, because the checkmark indicates a negative, failure, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> This one is difficult. The safer options to use internationally would be either to write down 🆗 or adopt the east-asian circle (⭕︎) for confirmation, and the cross (❌) sign for a negative. Think of a gameshow bell for ⭕︎ and the buzzer for ❌. Crosses can do mean positive though, for example in checkboxes. Maybe I will revisit this issue in the future after thinking over it some more.</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful. If you know of similar practices or have any of your own suggestions, feel free to reach out to me over github or directly at omar@ajerray.de.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and stay safe.</p>
<p>Omar</p>
